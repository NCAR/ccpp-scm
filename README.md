The SCM is a tool for developing physics suites and diagnosing their performance. This SCM works with the
- [Common Community Physics Package (CCPP):](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics) a library of physical parameterizations for atmospheric numerical models.
- [CCPP Framework:](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework) a framework for connecting atmospheric models to physics suites.
