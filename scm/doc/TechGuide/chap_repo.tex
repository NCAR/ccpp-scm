\section{What is included in the repository?}
The repository contains all code and data required to run the GMTB SCM. It is functionally separated into 4 subdirectories representing the SCM model infrastructure (\execout{scm} directory), the CCPP infrastructure (\execout{ccpp-framework} directory), the CCPP physics schemes (\execout{ccpp-physics} directory), and any necessary external library code (\execout{external} directory). The entire \execout{gmtb-scm} repository resides on github's NCAR account, and the \execout{ccpp-framework} and \execout{ccpp-physics} directories are git submodules that point to repositories on the same account. The structure of the entire repository is represented below. Note that the \execout{ccpp\_physics} repository contains files needed for using the CCPP with the experimental version of the Global Forecast System (GFS) that uses the Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) model (FV3GFS), even though the use of CCPP with FV3GFS is not supported in this release.
