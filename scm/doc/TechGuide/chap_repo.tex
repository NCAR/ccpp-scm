\section{What is included in the repository?}
The repository contains all code required to build the CCPP SCM and scripts that can be used to obtain data to run it (e.g. downloading large initialization tables for the Thompson microphysics schemes discussed in subsection \ref{subsection: singlerunscript} and processed case data). It is functionally separated into 3 subdirectories representing the SCM model infrastructure (\execout{scm} directory), the CCPP infrastructure (\execout{ccpp/framework} directory), and the CCPP physics schemes (\execout{ccpp/physics} directory). The entire \execout{ccpp-scm} repository resides on Github's NCAR space, and the \execout{ccpp/framework} and \execout{ccpp/physics} directories are git submodules that point to repositories \execout{ccpp-framework} and \execout{ccpp-physics} on the same space. The structure of the entire repository is represented below. Note that the \execout{ccpp-physics} repository also contains files needed for using the CCPP with the UFS Atmosphere host model that uses the Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) dynamical core.
