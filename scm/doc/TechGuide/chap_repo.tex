\section{What is included in the repository?}
The repository contains all code and data required to run the GMTB SCM (with the exception of large initialization tables for the Thompson microphysics scheme discussed in subsection \ref{subsection: singlerunscript}). It is functionally separated into 3 subdirectories representing the SCM model infrastructure (\execout{scm} directory), the CCPP infrastructure (\execout{ccpp/framework} directory), and the CCPP physics schemes (\execout{ccpp/physics} directory). The entire \execout{gmtb-scm} repository resides on Github's NCAR account, and the \execout{ccpp/framework} and \execout{ccpp/physics} directories are git submodules that point to repositories \execout{ccpp-framework} and \execout{ccpp-physics} on the same account. The structure of the entire repository is represented below. Note that the \execout{ccpp-physics} repository contains files needed for using the CCPP with the UFS Atmosphere host model that uses the Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) dynamical core, even though the use of CCPP with the UFS Atmosphere is not supported in this release.
