\label{chapter: introduction}

A single column model (SCM) can be a valuable tool for diagnosing the performance of a physics suite, from validating that schemes have been integrated into a suite correctly to deep dives into how physical processes are being represented by the approximating code. This SCM has the advantage of working with the Common Community Physics Package (CCPP), a library of physical parameterizations for atmospheric numerical models and the associated framework for connecting potentially any atmospheric model to physics suites constructed from its member parameterizations. In fact, this SCM serves as perhaps the simplest example for using the CCPP and its framework in an atmospheric model. This version contains all parameterizations of NOAA's evolved operational GFS v15.2 suite (implemented in 2019), plus additional developmental schemes. The schemes are grouped in five supported suites described in detail in the \href{https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/GMTB/v5.0.0/sci_doc/}{CCPP Scientific Documentation} (GFS\_v15p2, GFS\_v16beta, csawmg, GSD\_v1, and RRFS\_v1alpha).

This document serves as both the User and Technical Guides for this model. It contains a Quick Start Guide with instructions for obtaining the code, compiling, and running a sample test case, an explanation for what is included in the repository, a brief description of the operation of the model, a description of how cases are set up and run, and finally, an explanation for how the model interfaces with physics through the CCPP infrastructure.

\section{Version Notes}

The CCPP SCM v5.0.0 contains the following major and minor changes since v4.1.

Major
\begin{itemize}
\item None
\end{itemize}

Minor
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracers are configured externally via a file, to match the ``field\_table'' functionality in FV3
\item Add the RRFS\_v1alpha suite to match the UFS SRW App version 1 public release: \url{https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}
\item Added ability to run with HWRF physics
\item Fixed bug related to prescribed surface flux cases (bug was present in v4.1.0)
\item Updated UFS initial conditions case generation script to better handle LSM-related variables
\item Update SCM surface initialization code to better match FV3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

This release bundle has some known limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the RRFS\_v1alpha suite for cases where deep convection is expected to be active will likely produce strange/unreliable results, unless the forcing has been modified to account for the deep convection. This is because forcing for existing cases assumes a horizontal scale for which deep convection is subgrid-scale and is expected to be parameterized. The RRFS\_v1alpha suite is intended for use with regional UFS simulations with horizontal scale small enough not to need a deep convection parameterization active, and it does not contain a deep convective scheme. Nevertheless, the RRFS\_v1alpha suite is included with the SCM as-is for research purposes.
\item The provided cases over land points cannot use an LSM at this time due to the lack of initialization data for the LSMs. Therefore, for the provided cases over land points (ARM\_SGP\_summer\_1997\_* and LASSO\_*, where sfc\_type = 1 is set in the case configuration file), prescribed surface fluxes must be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item surface sensible and latent heat fluxes must be provided in the case data file
\item sfc\_flux\_spec must be set to true in the case configuration file
\item the surface roughness length in cm must be set in the case configuration file
\item the suite defintion file used (physics\_suite variable in the case configuration file) must have been modified to use prescribed surface fluxes rather than an LSM.
\item NOTE: If one can develop appropriate initial conditions for the LSMs for the supplied cases over land points, there should be no technical reason why they cannot be used with LSMs, however.
\end{itemize}
\item As of this release, using the SCM over a land point with an LSM is possible through the use of UFS initial conditions (see section \ref{sec:UFS ICs}). However, advective forcing terms are unavailable as of this release, so only short integrations using this configuration should be employed. Using dynamical tendencies (advective forcing terms) from the UFS will be part of a future release.
\item There are several capabilities of the developmental code that have not been tested sufficiently to be considered part of the supported release. Those include additional parameterizations. Users that want to use experimental capabilities should refer to Subsection \ref{section: development_code}.
\end{itemize}
